This is a sample LaTeX post.

### Inline $\LaTeX$

On a  $N$ dimensional differentiable [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold)  $\beta$, the metric tensor is given as a covariant, second-degree, symmetric tensor. It is usually represented by  $g$. 

### Equations

The distance reported by the two observers would be

 $$  ds_1^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 $$

 and

 $$  ds_2^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2. $$

Here,

 $$  ds_1 = ds_2. $$

### Matrix
Some inline LaTeX  $  g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu}$ and 

 $$  \eta_{\mu \nu} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \end{pmatrix} $$

gives
 
 $$  ds^2  = - dt^2 + a(t)^2 dx^2 + a(t)^2 dy^2 + a(t)^2 dz^2 $$

Now, relating it to the distance between the two points in Minkowski space, we can see that the metric here is

 $$  g_{\mu \nu} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & a(t)^2 & 0 & \\ 0 & 0 & a(t)^2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & a(t)^2  \end{pmatrix} $$

This metric is known as Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric. This metric describes the universe that is flat but expanding.
