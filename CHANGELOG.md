# Changelog

## To do
*   Add a light colour scheme
*   The user should be able to switch between two formats of the home page -- one that shows their introduction and the other that shows their posts.
*   Do something about the "Links" tab in the top bar. 
*   The navigation buttons at the bottom of posts should keep the user within the category of that specific post, so that they go to the last/next post in that specific category.
*   Allow people to subscribe to a specific category.
*   Fix the issue with rounded corners of the tables that have more than three columns.
